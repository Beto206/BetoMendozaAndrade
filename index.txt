About me

I'm Alberto Mendoza Andrade, a Business Technology Analyst at Deloitte, aspiring Product Manager, and entrepreneur from Seattle, Washington. I’m passionate about solving complex problems with practical, user-centered solutions. This includes building intuitive digital products, driving strategic initiatives, and improving service delivery across industries.

I specialize in connecting technology with people. At 18, I co-founded and operated my family’s construction business, where I led project estimation, client relations, digital marketing, and financial management. During my four-year tenure, I helped generate over $1 million in revenue and increased project leads by 400 percent. That experience shaped my ability to lead under pressure, adapt quickly, and deliver meaningful results.

At Deloitte, I apply the same mindset to help clients modernize workflows, streamline operations, and achieve lasting impact.

My goal is simple: to make your vision clear, compelling, and scalable. I don’t just consult or design. I bring ideas to life in a way that is both effective and uniquely yours.
